#Simulation of Processes Scheduling
This program is to simulate processes scheduling.
#introduction
This program is to simulate processes scheduling.I use static priority-driven nonpreemptive scheduling(in the function execute()) and round robin scheduling(in the function execute2()) to schedule processes.
First, according to the priority of the processes inputed by user, function sort() sort these processes in the list.Next, when you use execute(), it schedules the processes according to static priority-driven nonpreemptive scheduling;when you use function execute2(), it uses the other.
